      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>There is a reason Clean Coastlines was designed. This is a school
      project to help spread awareness to students, that we need to keep our
      coastlines clean. 2019 was the year Auckland was considered by the
      Ministry for the Environment to have the most polluted waterways. 62
      percent of rivers and lakes were graded poor, none graded as good.
      However, there is an organisation out there in New Zealand known as
      Sustainable Coastlines.</p>

      <p>They are an organisation where they focus on cleaning our waters.
      Therefore, building this website was aimed to support their cause. It is
      meant to bring them the opportunity to clean our oceans, if we no longer
      want to see waters filled with rubbish. This is the case with Auckland's
      polluted waters.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="column">
    <!--Explaing the mission of keeping waterways clean in New Zealand.-->
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <!--Making sure the text stands out on its cyan background-->
    <p style="color:#FFF"> In New Zealand, Sustainable Coastlines is an
    organisation that is a registered New Zealand charity. More importantly,
    they are on a mission to keep coastlines and waterways safe from
    pollution.</p>

    <p style="color:#FFF">Therefore, they deliver coastal clean-up events,
    public awareness campaigns, educational programmes, and riparian planting
    projects. They work with local community groups, interns, volunteers, and
    ambassadors. Also, work with people to enable them, delivering those
    activities into their own communities.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Information on Sustainable Coastline's goals-->
    <div class="column2">
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Coastlines love coasts and oceans, they want them litter free.
    They clean up beaches and deliver education to prevent litter, especially
    single-use plastics. Waters in New Zealand need our aid. As a result, they
    restore waterways by planting trees. Secondly, enable communities to
    scale-up local solutions. Finally, educate people on the issues concerning
    freshwater.</p>

    <p>Many people created the challenges we face with the state of our oceans today.
    So it has become our responsibility to keep our coastlines sustainable. This
    organisation uses behaviour-focused education, inspiring events and training
    to encourage people to take care of the places they love. Sustainable
    Coastlines provide three programmes to achieve their goals.</p>
    </div>

    <!--Talking about programmes that help with keeping our oceans clean.-->
    <div class="column3">
    <h2>Litter Intelligence</h2>
    <!--Making sure looks even on columns-->
    <p style="font-size:16px">Litter Intelligence is their newest programme,
    launched on May 2018. This programme involves collecting litter data,
    inspires widespread action for solutions, and powerful insights about
    the problem. It all comes down to improving decision making to solve our
    litter problem.</p>

    <h2>Love Your Coast</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">Beach clean ups have been important to them,
    from the beginning. Plastic pollution however, is not solved by easily
    collecting it where it ends up. As a result, this program will provide
    education into the equation, delivering positive change in the everyday
    lives of people.</p>

    <h2>Love Your Water</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">Keeping waterways free of litter is the main
    aspect of keeping waters sustainable. Yet it is not the only solution. This
    program enables practical action - tree planting - and education on pollution
    in our inland lakes and rivers. It all is meant to make sure the health of our
    waterways before they flow to the sea.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#33A0BD">Keeping waters sustainable</h2><!--Section's title color (cyan).-->
    <p>1. Conserve water, so excess runoff and wastewater will not flow into
    the ocean.</p>
    <p>2. Reduce pollutants by disposing herbicides, pesticides, and cleaning
    products properly.</p>
    <p>3. Reduce waste by cutting down what you throw away.</p>
    <p>4. Shop wisely. You can do this by bringing a reusable bag and choose
    sustainable seafood.</p>
    <p>5. Use fuel efficient vehicles, or ride a bike. That is how you
    reduce vehicle pollution.</p>
    <p>6. Use less energy so it does not overset your thermostat.</p>
    <p>7. Follow "catch and release" practices, keeping more fish alive.</p>
    <p>8. Anchor in sandy areas far from coral and sea grasses.</p>
    <p>9. Survival and healthy habitat go hand in hand. Must treat with care.</p>
    <p>10. Volunteer for cleanups hosted by Sustainable Coastlines.</p>
